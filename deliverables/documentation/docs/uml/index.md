# UML diagrams

During the development of this project, we have created several UML diagrams to help us understand
the structure of the project and to help us communicate with each other.

We described the architecture of the project using **class diagrams**:

- [Client (overview)]()
- [Client (detail)]()
- [Server (overview)]()
- [Server (detail)]()
- [Complete architecture](Network-Controller-Model_UML.pdf)

---

We also created **sequence diagrams** to describe the communication protocol between the client and the server:

- [Client-server network communication protocol](NetworkCommunicationProtocol_SequenceDiagram.html)
