# Welcome to MyShelfie`s documentation!

[Go to the **JavaDoc!**](javadoc){ .md-button }

MyShelfie is a game developed by Cranio Creations, as a physical board game.

This project is a digital adaptation of the game, developed by the **GC07** team, as part of the Software Engineering course at Politecnico di Milano.

The team members are:

- [Gabriele Puglisi](https://github.com/GabP404)
- [Matteo Santelmo](https://github.com/matsant01)
- [Giuseppe Steduto](https://github.com/giuseppe-steduto)

Following the best practices of software engineering, we made sure that our code is well documented and tested.
The Javadoc is available [here](javadoc).
The test coverage report is available [here](test-coverage).

If you want to peek into our development process, we have described it and the tools 
we have used in the [development process](development-process) page.
